								<p>Kronos is a top down shooter that I had to design mechanics and a map for in unreal engine 4. I decided to make my main character the greek god Kronos, the mechanics that were developed for the project was time control and guard wall</p>
								<p>Goal: The goal was to make a mechanic suitable for a top-down shooter and design a level.</p>
								<p>Inspirations: I was heavily inspired by the game Hades and also the greek god Kronos.</p>
								<p>What have I learned?
									<li>How to design and document a top-down shooter level.</li>
									<li>How to tie in characters with use of story and setting.</li>
									<li>How to use affordance in a 3D space.</li>
									<li>Learn to use the cinematic tools to make a trailer.</li>
								</p>
								<p>
									What are my thoughts on the project?
								</p>
								<p>
									The only mechanic that I wasn't able to impliment was the fireball, I think the addition of this mechanic would have had some interesting gameplay. Overall I belive this project went in the direction that I expected it to go, I had a lot of fun coming up with the mechanics and designing them and wondeing about the impact of it on the game. This was my first attemp at a design document and it covered all basis in terms of documentation.
