                                <p>This title was developed in a team of 15 members where I played the role of Lead Level Designer and Senior Game Designer. My role was to oversee create a level design and creating the level design document. Some of my other responsibilities included managing the github repository for the team, guiding juniors in using unreal engine and in the process of level design, communicating to programmers and artists about the games vision and direction, QA test the game frequently.
                                </p>
                                <br/>
                                <p>Responsibilities:</p>
                                <li>Oversee Level Design Team using Jira</li>
                                <li>Manage Github for the team</li>
                                <li>Comunicate with project leads of each department</li>
                                <li>Showcase and pitch to a team from an established AAA studio</li>
                                <li>Create and finalize levels for the game</li>
                                <li>Test the game frequently for bugs</li>

									What did I learn from this project:
								</p>
								<p>
									The main learning experience for me during the project time frame was handeling my own team of level designers. Managing their daily tasks and catching up with them to quality control and to check if they had accomplished those tasks at the end of the day using teams and Jira. I also had to teach some of my juniors on speeding up their workflow in their departments. Brainstorming sessions were fun where all departments got together and threw ideas at each others. I also had a lot of fun organizing the team in terms of source control which was my responsibility. This project game me an opportunity to present the title in front of an experienced team from a AAA studio for our feedback session.
