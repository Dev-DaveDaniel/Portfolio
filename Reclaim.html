								<p>Reclaim is a 2D metroidvania project where I developed an entire level on one core mechanic. The core mechanic that sets this game apart is the ingenious use of a versatile knife, which becomes the key to overcoming the challenging landscapes that lie ahead. players must strategically throw the knife at specific surfaces, creating temporary ledges to propel themselves forward, reaching otherwise unreachable areas.</p>
								<p>Goal: The goal was to make a mechanic suitable for a metroidvania style game.</p>
								<p>Inspirations: I took inspiration from Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Prince of Persia and Hollow Knight.</p>
								<p>What have I learned?
									<li>How to design and document a 2D metroidvania level.</li>
									<li>How to tie in characters with use of story and setting.</li>
									<li>How to use focal points as indicators in progression in a 2D game.</li>
								</p>
								<p>
									What did I take away?
									<br/>
									Overall this project was a win for me. I acheived all my goals and I think taht was due to scaling down the project size in term of mechanics. I made one polished mechanic that can be used in multiple forms. This brought a lot of elevation in my level, which is what is usually missing from my levels. The design documentation was really good this time around as it was my second attempt at the process. I learned from any mistakes i made the first time around and made the required changes.
